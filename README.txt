K-Means.py:
Computes the K-Means clustering of n data points given k amnt of clusters 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* REQUIREMENTS:
-To test K-Means it is preffered you have python 2.7,

-You must make sure that all the data files are of format .csv and are in the folder that the .py file is in otherwise there will be a
directory problem and the program will not be able to read the files

*Opening FILE:
Go into the k-means folder and open the .py file using pycharm or some python IDE

*Running program:
-To run the K-Means for every exercise you want to run you need to change the file name on line 9 to match the file you want to run, 
the filename is within single quotes.

-Also depending on what the columns are called you have to change the column names on line 68 and 69. For simplicity we edited the
colmun names in the file so they are all the same and you do not have to change that field

-To change the number of clusters you want you have to go to line 85 and change the value of k to be anywhere between 1-4

-Click the run button to see the results once you have modified the neccessary lines

RESULTS:
*The results/plots will be saved in the folder that contains the .py file as .png
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GiftW.Java:
Computes the convex hull of the data points
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* REQUIREMENTS
-To test the gift wrap you need to have java eclipse

-The data files need to be in .txt for java to read it and must have single space between the x and y coordinates 

*Opening FILE:
-Open the ConvexHull folder and double click the src folder, inside there will be 2.java files and 1 folder called Plotter

-Open the GiftW.java file by double cliking it or by opening it thorugh your Java IDE

*Running program:
-To test for various exercises you need to scroll down to the main method and edit the file name at line 76, change the file name within
the quotes to the appropriate exercise you want to run.

RESULTS:
-Once the program has finished it will show the hull points in the console window, and print a filie called pointsFile.txt wih the hull point

	PLOTTING:
	-To see the graph you need to copy the pointsFile.txt to the Plotter folder and replace the pointsFile.txt thats already there.
	  You must do this everytime you run a new exercise.
	
	-Once the pointsFile.txt has been replaced you need to open the plotter.py python file using your python IDE, preferably pycharm
	
	-Once the plotter.py file is open you need to change the file name on line 13 to the file name of the exercise that you ran on Java
	  momentarly. This is neccesary to plot the orignal points. 
	
	-Click the run button to see the plots.
